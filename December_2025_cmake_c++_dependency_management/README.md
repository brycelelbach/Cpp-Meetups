# Cross Platform C++ Dependency Management with CMake 

This is a talk on using modern(as at December 2025) CMake to manage dependencies between C++ projects.

This folder contains a pdf version of the supporting text from the presentation.

The Text is just an overview summary, where the bulk of the content is contained in the video as I do some playing on the terminal as well as show other resources not in the slides.

The video can be viewed on [youtube](https://youtu.be/OlVlEaN6EOQ)

Also included is the Toy CMake project that I play around with in the presentation.
